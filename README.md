#Â ruby-czmq-ffi

ruby-czmq-ffi provides low-level Ruby bindings for the
[CZMQ](http://czmq.zeromq.org/) library. ruby-czmq-ffi leverages the FFI
mechanism, and thus should work on all the main Ruby VMs: YARV/MRI, JRuby, and
Rubinius.

The ruby-czmq-ffi library was not designed to be used directly by applications,
but instead to provide functions for higher-level gems such as
[ruby-czmq](https://github.com/mtortonesi/ruby-czmq).
